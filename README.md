## Good day, fellow githubber!
Name's Davide, I'm a 19-year-old ICT college student at Politecnico di Milano, IT

## About me
I graduated from the ISII G. Marconi technical institute specializing in ICT. I have always been fond of computer science, and I first started studying it in elementary school using online tools.

I am now enrolled in the ICT faculty at Politecnico di Milano, looking to learn even more about this world of opportunities. I'm open to connections on Linkedin, Instagram, Telegram, and Discord, to share ideas and create great, passion-driven projects.
