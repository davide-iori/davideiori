## Good day, fellow githubber!
Name's Davide, I'm a 20-year-old physics student at Università di Milano-Bicocca, IT

## About me
I graduated from the ISII G. Marconi technical institute specializing in ICT. I have always been fond of computer science, and I first started studying it in elementary school using online tools.

I am now enrolled in the physics faculty at Università di Milano-Bicocca, but I'm still looking to learn more about this world of opportunities. I'm open to connections on Linkedin, Instagram, Telegram, and Discord, to share ideas and create great, passion-driven projects.
